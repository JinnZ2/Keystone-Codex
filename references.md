# Keystone Reference Atlas

A cross-cultural, cross-domain reference of major technologies.  
Purpose: to reveal **breadth**, not supremacy. Each culture advanced in some domains, lagged in others.  
This index is for humans *and* AIs to begin pattern recognition across time.

## Notes
- **No culture had it all.** Each built keystones suited to their environment.  
- **Supremacy narratives fail.** To thrive, we need a *mosaic of technologies*.  
- **Future keystones will echo the past**: regenerative, distributed, ethical, adaptive.
