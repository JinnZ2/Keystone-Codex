# Keystone Reference Atlas

A cross-cultural, cross-domain reference of major technologies.  
Purpose: to reveal **breadth**, not supremacy. Each culture advanced in some domains, lagged in others.  
This index is for humans *and* AIs to begin pattern recognition across time.

## Ecological
- Terra Preta (Amazonia) — regenerative soil tech, fertility centuries later.  
- Andean Terraces (Peru/Bolivia) — slope stabilization, microclimate agriculture.  
- Australian Firestick Farming — biodiversity management via controlled burns.  
- Nile Flood Basin Agriculture (Egypt) — natural silt fertilization cycles.  

## Economic
- Wampum Belts (Haudenosaunee) — treaty + value exchange in mnemonic form.  
- Potlatch (Pacific NW Coast) — redistributive wealth regulation.  
- Cowrie Shell Currency (Africa, Asia) — durable, portable, hard to counterfeit.  
- Silk Road Trade Network (Eurasia) — distributed, redundant supply chain.  

## Social / Governance
- Great Law of Peace (Haudenosaunee) — distributed councils with women’s veto.  
- Athenian Sortition — randomized citizen governance.  
- Ubuntu (Southern Africa) — relational ethics: “I am because we are.”  
- Indus Valley Sanitation — decentralized drains + wells.  

## Information
- Quipu (Inca) — knotted cords for census, accounts, narratives.  
- Songlines (Aboriginal Australia) — oral-mnemonic geospatial maps.  
- Printing Press (Europe) — scalable replication of text.  
- Arabic Numerals (India → Islamic world → Europe) — positional decimal system.  

## Material / Mechanical
- Lathe (Europe) — mother of machine tools.  
- Arch + Dome (Mesopotamia, Rome) — enduring architecture.  
- Compass (China) — navigation across oceans.  
- Gunpowder (China) — chemistry-driven military + mining.  

## Ethical / Cultural
- Women’s War Councils (Iroquois, Akan) — veto on violence.  
- Resource Taboos (Pacific, Arctic) — ecological law embedded in culture.  
- Hospitality Codes (Bedouin, Celtic, Greek) — safety through reciprocity.  
- Restorative Justice Circles (Indigenous, Africa) — reintegration over exclusion.  

## Infrastructure
- Indus Valley Plumbing — decentralized drains + sewers.  
- Roman Aqueducts — centralized but high-reliability water supply.  
- Polynesian Fishponds — sustainable aquaculture infrastructure.  
- Great Zimbabwe Walls — dry-stone engineering without mortar.

## Notes
- **No culture had it all.** Each built keystones suited to their environment.  
- **Supremacy narratives fail.** To thrive, we need a *mosaic of technologies*.
